### Little Canvas Engine

Simple engine to simplify and alleviate work such as gameloops, clocks, rendering, etc.

Maybe a very careful comparison with p5 but waaaaay more naive <br/>
@see p5.js [https://p5js.org/](https://p5js.org/)

### Installation

`pnpm i && pnpm run dev`

### Usage

Documentation to use the engine follows in later iterations
